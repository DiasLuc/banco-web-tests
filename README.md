# Banco Web Tests (Mentoria 2.0)

## Objective
This project aims to demonstrate to "Mentoria 2.0" students how to automate web application tests using Cypress, JavaScript, and best practices for code organization.

## Project Components
- **Cypress**: Main end-to-end test automation framework.
- **Custom Commands**: Custom commands to simplify and maintain test code, located in `cypress/support/commands/`.
- **Reports**: HTML reports generated using `cypress-mochawesome-reporter`.
- **Folder Structure**:
  - `cypress/e2e/`: Contains test files (`login.cy.js`, `transferencia.cy.js`).
  - `cypress/support/commands/`: Reusable custom commands.
  - `cypress/fixtures/`: Test data and fixtures.
  - `cypress/reports/`: Reports generated after test execution.
  - `screenshots/` and `videos/`: Evidence automatically generated by Cypress.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Clone and run the following applications:
  - [banco-api](https://github.com/juliodelimas/banco-api)gi 
  - [banco-web](https://github.com/juliodelimas/banco-web)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   cd banco-web-tests
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Tests
1. Make sure both the API and the front-end are running locally.
2. Run the tests with Cypress:
   - Interactive mode:
     ```bash
     npx cypress open
     ```
   - Headless mode (with report generation):
     ```bash
     npx cypress run --reporter cypress-mochawesome-reporter --reporter-options reportDir=cypress/reports/html,overwrite=false,html=true,json=false
     ```
3. Access the report at `cypress/reports/html/index.html`.

## Test Documentation
### login.cy.js
- **Login with valid data**: Ensures the user can access the system with correct credentials.
- **Login with invalid data**: Checks if an error message is displayed when trying to log in with incorrect credentials.

### transferencia.cy.js
- Tests related to the bank transfer functionality (see file for details).

## Custom Commands
Custom commands are located in `cypress/support/commands/` and include:
- `cy.loginWithValidCredentials()`: Logs in with valid credentials.
- `cy.loginWithInvalidCredentials()`: Attempts login with invalid credentials.
- `cy.verifyToastMessage(message)`: Checks if a specific toast message is displayed.
- Other commands to simplify common actions in tests.
